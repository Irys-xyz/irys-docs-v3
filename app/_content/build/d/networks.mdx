# Networks

Irys has two Bundler networks:

- **Mainnet**: Uploads are paid for with real tokens. At mainnet L1 launch, all data uploaded to these bundlers will be uploaded to mainnet, with no changes to transaction IDs.
- **Devnet**: Uploads are paid for with free faucet tokens. Data is deleted after ~60 days.

As well as an [L1 testnet](/build/programmability/introduction).


## Connecting to the Mainnet bundler

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
The following code is for using ethereum only, we [also have examples covering all of the tokens we support for payment](/build/d/sdk/setup). 
</Callout>

```ts
import { Uploader } from "@irys/upload";
import { Ethereum } from "@irys/upload-ethereum";
 
const getIrysUploader = async () => {
  const irysUploader = await Uploader(Ethereum).withWallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);
  return irysUploader;
};
```

## Connecting to the Devnet bundler

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
The following code is for using ethereum only, we [also have examples covering all of the tokens we support for payment](/build/d/sdk/setup). 
</Callout>

To connect to devnet, append the functions `withRpc()` and `devnet()`. RPC URLs are required when using devnet. 

```ts
import { Uploader } from "@irys/upload";
import { Ethereum } from "@irys/upload-ethereum";
 
const getIrysUploader = async () => {
  // RPC URLs change often. Use a current one from https://chainlist.org/
  const rpcURL = ""; 
  const irysUploader = await Uploader(Ethereum)
    .withWallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY)
    .withRpc(rpcURL)
    .devnet();

  return irysUploader;
};
```
